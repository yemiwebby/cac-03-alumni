# CAC-03 Alumni Birthday Reminder System

An automated WhatsApp birthday reminder system for the CAC-03 Alumni Association using Go and GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Daily Birthday Reminders**: Automatically sends WhatsApp messages for upcoming birthdays
- **Monthly Birthday Reports**: Sends monthly summaries of all birthdays in the upcoming month
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart deduplication to prevent multiple messages for the same person
- **Flexible Scheduling**: GitHub Actions with manual triggers and automated scheduling
- **Target Month Override**: Ability to send monthly reports for specific months

## How It Works

The system reads birthday data from a CSV file and sends WhatsApp messages using the WhatsApp Business API when:
- **Daily**: Someone has a birthday tomorrow (configurable lookahead)
- **Monthly**: At the start of each month with all birthdays for that month

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `WA_PHONE_ID`: WhatsApp Business Phone Number ID
- `WA_TOKEN`: WhatsApp Business API Access Token
- `WA_TEMPLATE`: WhatsApp template name (default: `cac_template_birthday`)

### CSV Data Security
üîê **CSV data is stored as an encrypted GitHub Secret** (`CSV_DATA`) rather than in the repository files. This provides:
- **Complete privacy** - No alumni data visible in public repository
- **Secure access** - Only authorized workflows can access the data
- **Easy updates** - Update CSV by modifying the GitHub Secret
- **GitHub Actions compatibility** - File created dynamically during execution

### CSV Data Format
The system expects a CSV file with these columns:
- `FULL NAME (SCHOOL SURNAME FIRST)`
- `DATE OF BIRTH` (YYYY-MM-DD format)

## Security & Privacy

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes**:
- Repository contains sensitive alumni data (names, birthdates, contact info)
- Manual workflow triggers are **restricted to repository owner only**
- WhatsApp API credentials are stored as encrypted GitHub Secrets
- All manual executions include authorization checks
- **Recommendation**: Consider making this repository private
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security guidelines

### Authorization
Only the repository owner can manually trigger workflows. Unauthorized attempts will be logged and blocked.

### Data Protection
- Personal data is processed according to privacy regulations
- CSV data includes full names, birth dates, and contact information
- Regular audits recommended for data accuracy and consent
- Consider implementing data retention policies

## Duplicate Prevention

The system automatically handles duplicate entries by:
- Creating unique keys based on name + birth month + birth day
- Case-insensitive name matching
- Skipping subsequent duplicate entries
- Ensuring only one message per person per birthday
